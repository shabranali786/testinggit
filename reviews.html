                <p>"I loved working with Shellie. We thought her proposal was the most professional right from the start and her work matched what we were looking for in a web-site redesign. She is very responsive and answered emails almost immediately and
                    on weekends. I'm thrilled with the website now and am enabled to make minor changes and alterations easily and BY MYSELF (which my prior web designer locked me out from making any changes). What really changed things for me and her
                    understanding of what I was trying to get accomplished with the website was a phone call where I talked about my business (15 years running) and how the website has changed over and over (my 5th website). That is when it all really
                    clicked and the images, text content and visual aspects sprang to life. Wonderful stuff. I'd highly recommend her and have a phone call to discuss where you are at currently and where you'd like to go."</p>
